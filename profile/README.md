# LMRI: Ionizing Radiation Metrology Laboratory
The [Ionizing Radiation Metrology Laboratory](https://rdgroups.ciemat.es/web/lmri) (LMRI for its acronym in Spanish), is the Spanish national reference laboratory for establishing, maintaining and disseminating national standards for ionizing radiation magnitudes.

## Facilities
The LMRI has three groups of laboratories:

1. **Radionuclide Metrology Laboratories**:
Its aim is to maintain the national standard of activity (becquerel).
It consists of three laboratories:
- Alpha standards laboratory.
- Liquid scintillation measurements laboratory.
- Gamma spectrometry and coincidence measurements laboratory.

2. **Dosimetric Standards Laboratories**:
Its aim is to maintain the national standards of activity activity (becquerel), exposure (coulomb·kg<sup>-1</sup>), kerma (gray) and absorbed dose (gray).
It consists of three laboratories:
- Reference laboratory for gamma radiation at protection levels.
- Reference laboratory for X-rays at protection levels.
- Reference laboratory for gamma at hospital therapy levels.
- Reference laboratory for beta radiation at protection levels.

3. **Neutron Standards Laboratory**:
Its aim is to maintain the national standard of fluence (m<sup>-2</sup>).

## Objectives
The goals of the LMRI are:
1. To establish, maintain and disseminate on behalf of the State the National Standards of the SI units of Activity (becquerel), Exposure (coulomb.kg-1), Kerma (gray) and Absorbed Dose (gray), as an Associated Laboratory to the Spanish Metrology Center (CEM) in the field of ionizing radiation.
2. To assume the national representation in the field of ionizing radiation metrology in international organizations, such as the Comité International des Poids et Mésures (CIPM), Comité Consultatif pour les Rayonnements Ionisants (CCRI), Bureau International des Poids et Mésures (BIPM), International Committee for Radionuclide Metrology (ICRM), European Collaboration of National Metrology Institutes (EURAMET) and others.
3. To ensure the international traceability of National Standards for ionizing radiation by complying with the requirements of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement of the National Institutes of Metrology (MRA), promoted by the Comité International des Poids et Mésures since 1999, establishing an ISO 17025 Quality System and participating in the CIPM/BIPM Key Intercomparisons, in the EURAMET supplementary ones and in the BIPM "Système International de Référence" (SIR).

## Activities
To meet its objectives, the LMRI carries out the following activities:
1. Establishment of new standards and measurement techniques.
2. Maintenance and traceability.
3. Dissemination of units.
