# LMRI-Met: Ionizing Radiation Metrology Laboratory

## About the LMRI

The [Ionizing Radiation Metrology Laboratory](https://rdgroups.ciemat.es/web/lmri) (LMRI for its acronym in Spanish), is the Spanish national reference laboratory for establishing, maintaining and disseminating national standards for ionizing radiation magnitudes.
The LMRI has three groups of laboratories:

1. **Radionuclide Metrology Laboratories**:
It consists of three laboratories:
- Alpha standards laboratory.
- Liquid scintillation measurements laboratory.
- Gamma spectrometry and coincidence measurements laboratory.

2. **Dosimetric Standards Laboratories**:
It consists of four laboratories:
- Reference laboratory for gamma radiation at protection levels.
- Reference laboratory for X-rays at protection levels.
- Reference laboratory for gamma at hospital therapy levels.
- Reference laboratory for beta radiation at protection levels.

3. **Neutron Standards Laboratory**:
Its aim is to maintain the national standard of fluence (m<sup>-2</sup>).

## About the LMRI GitHub Organization

The aim of this GitHub organization is to provide a central site to host the code repositories developed within the LMRI.
The organization provides a way for anyone in the LMRI to host their code on GitHub, facilitating the use of synchronization on the cloud, the use of version control, the reusability of code between projects, and the collaboration between LMRI members.

Any code developed to automate any repetitive task or to solve a single task of a laboratory can be hosted in the organization. 
Any member of the LMRI can join the organization to host their code repositories. 
This organization is meant to be public. 

## Naming conventions

Repositories to host static websites must be named ``sites-name``.
